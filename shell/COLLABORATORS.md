Shell Lab

This repository contains the code for the python shell lab. The
purpose is to have a shell that handles one IO redirect and one pipe.
This shell is written in Python 2.7.14.
In the repository there is a file called "shellLab.py" which is the shell.
Please refer to Readme file for shell features.

For this lab assignment I received help from Abigail Lira to understand 
and implement various concepts such as the 'PS1' environment variable, 
general idea and implementation of "redirect to" and "pipe" using subprocess.

Some code was extracted from the demos provided.

External resources used for code reference, concept understanding and implementation:
